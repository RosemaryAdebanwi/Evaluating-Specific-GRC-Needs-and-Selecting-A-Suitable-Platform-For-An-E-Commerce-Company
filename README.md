# Evaluating Specific GRC Needs and Selecting A Suitable Platform For An E-Commerce Company

<h2>Overview:</h2>
As a GRC professional analyst, at an e-commerce company, I led a project to evaluate the companyâ€™s GRC needs and select a platform that would strengthen its data privacy management. With the increasing risks of data breaches and growing regulations like GDPR and CCPA, protecting sensitive client, employee, and third-party data became more critical than ever. I focused on choosing a GRC platform that ensured compliance while automating processes and seamlessly integrating with existing systems. The result was a tailored solution that enhanced privacy management, mitigated risks, and ensured the company stayed ahead of regulatory 
requirements.
